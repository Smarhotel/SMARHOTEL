      'the COVID-19 pandemic has required societal behavioral change in order to slow the spread of the virus. Making people keep proper distance when in public and wear face masks have become a priority for governments around the world. Following previous literature on the effects of behaviorally informed text messages on promoting healthy behavior, São Paulo’s innovation in government lab implemented a text message (SMS)-based intervention informed by behavioral insights aimed at encouraging people to stay at home, wear face masks, and maintain 2 meters distance from others. Specifically, five different SMS frameworks were analyzed – reciprocity towards health workers, social norms, civic duty, risk perception, and self-efficacy/ collective identity. A field experiment was run in which beliefs about the pandemic, awareness of safe distancing, and social distancing behaviors were measured via a telephone survey. Results indicate that individuals who received text messages became better informed about the correct distance they should keep from others, and more likely to wear a mask. Respondents who received the ‘civic duty’ frame, designed to prime a sense of duty to protect family and friends, were consistently better informed and more likely to always wear a mas than other frames, although this difference is small. Specifically, those who received the ‘civic duty’ message were 12.75% more likely to report the right distance to keep from others and 3% more likely to report always wearing a mask compared to those who did not received a text message. When looking at differences across groups, it was found that men express more risky behavior than women; older individuals go out less and wear a mask more; respondents in richer areas less likely to leave home for work, but more likely to exercise or walk the dog; and, one’s proximity to the disease affects belief and behavior, although differently depending on the relationship’s degree and on the severity of the illness. These results have informed the scale up of this intervention: a second text message intervention of 3 text messages to over 2.7 million citizens, a combined effort between the city Sao Paulo, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Partnership for Healthy Cities.',

      'Unsafe food poses global health threats, endangering everyone. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly and those with an underlying illness are particularly vulnerable. Every year 220 million children contract diarrhoeal diseases and 96 000 die. Unsafe food creates a vicious cycle of diarrhoea and malnutrition, threatening the nutritional status of the most vulnerable.The International Conference on Food Safety held in Addis Ababa in February 2019, and the International Forum on Food Safety and Trade held in Geneva in 2019, reiterated the importance of food safety in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Governments should make food safety a public health priority, as they play a pivotal role in developing policies and regulatory frameworks, and establishing and implementing effective food safety systems. Food can become contaminated at any point of production and distribution, and the primary responsibility lies with food producers. Yet a large proportion of foodborne disease incidents are caused by foods improperly prepared or mishandled at home, in food service establishments or at markets. Not all food handlers and consumers understand the roles they must play, such as adopting basic hygienic practices when buying, selling and preparing food to protect their health and that of the wider community.',

      'The construction of hospitals and other healthcare facilities has a significant impact on the environment in terms of material usage and consumption of energy and waste generation [1]. Therefore, sustainable construction of healthcare buildings demands the use of eco-friendly materials which can be recycled and have low embodied energy and environmental impact [2,3].The occupants of healthcare buildings including the patients and the staff, have a higher level of stress as compared to general populations [4]. In the patients, stress is mainly linked to the illness, while for the staff is linked to long working hours and the need to take life-saving decisions [4]. Past research has shown that the interior environment could reduce the level of this stress in the hospital building occupants [5]. One of the main modifications is the use of nature-based architectural themes which provide a healing and relaxing environment to the patients and the staff of healthcare buildings [6]. Wood is an organic and renewable resource of nature that is abundantly used for eco-friendly constructions and is an important component of nature-based themes [7]. Therefore, using wood material in the construction and designing of healthcare buildings can contribute to the reduction of stress in occupants and the improvement of sustainability markers of healthcare buildings [1,8]. This is the reason that the growing number of healthcare buildings are adapting this material. There is still hesitancy in widely adopting wood for indoor applications in healthcare buildings because this material is perceived as unhygienic owing to its porosity and organic nature [9]. However, some research has shown that untreated wood materials have antimicrobial properties against a wide range of pathogens responsible for healthcare-associated infections (HAI) [10]. Moreover, the most common microbes, including the SARS-CoV-2, survive least on porous materials as compared to smooth solid materials [11,12,13]. Meanwhile, the cleanability of wood is no worse than other materials such as plastic, glass, and steel [9].',
